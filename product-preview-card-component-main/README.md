## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out a product
preview card component and get it looking
as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I used the mobile design to add
the HTML structure and the CSS style.
Then I added a few media queries
to add the desktop CSS style.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add a thorough README file.
I learned how to use two images and display either image with a media query.
